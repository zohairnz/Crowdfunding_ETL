# Crowdfunding_ETL

Team Members
Brandon, Judy, Nilusha, Zohair

In this project our team was tasked with building an ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas. We were provided CSV and Excel data that included crowdfunding campaign contribution information. We cleaned up the data in those files and uploaded the files into a Postgres database. The manipulations included renaming, reordering and dropping columns from the data.
